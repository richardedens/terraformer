# Open PEN
The Open PEN project is a NodeJS/ TypeScript  web application that allows you to create a complete; wire frame, prototype and web application based upon just writing user stories.

Open PEN automatically creates all these parts while you can focus on writing "AS A(N)" ... "I WANT TO" ... "SO THAT I" user stories.

## No-Code R.A.D. 2.0!
Open PEN aims to a be a so called NO-Code, Rapid Application Development system. And focuses on making your live as a developer very easy.

Let us explain how it all works!

## How does it work?
Open PEN can be configured to spot keywords in between "AS A(N)" ... "I WANT TO" ... "SO THAT I" user stories text.

These keywords can be linked to:

* For the front-end generate a Single Page App or WebApplication.
* For the back-end generate a REST API's.
* For the infra structure setup a microservice architecture.

## What technology Open PEN outputs then?
Here comes the beauty of it. We give you the power to choose. That is right, we provide the interpreter and a set of compilers to common industry standard outputs for front-end applications, REST API's and microservice architecture.

But in the end .. you can also create your own compiler to do so for your favorite output!

Open PEN aims to be technology independent.
We focus much more in having your user stories in a compilable digital state. Then focusing on the output of the compilers.

So far we are working on the following compilers.

### Front-end
* Angular.IO
* ReactJS and Redux

### Backend API
* NodeJS + Express + TypeORM + Sequilizer

### Infra structure
* Azure

## Knowledge base
Open PEN is open, and we wish nothing more then that you contribute to the knowledge base of "COMMON WORDS" that can be compiled into something. 

## Open PEN aims to be Open Source
We really wish to bring a new wave in the low-code and no-code platforms that are out there and strive to
